# Introvert-Or-Extrovert
This project have been created for attending "Artificial Intelligence" exam in Engineering in Computer Science master course.
"Personality" dataset has been downloaded and explored in order to understand datas' characteristics: correlations, missing objects and span of values.
With some preprocessing datas have been uniformed, scaled and splitted in train/validation/test sets.
A dummy classifier is used to have some results as a baseline and a logistic regression, with an ablation of features, has been used to start evaluating some models and compare the results.
Next, a NN has been trained using firstly a fixed split and then using K-fold stratification. Results are evaluated and compared.
Lastly, a random forrest algoritgm is run.
